   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a publicly cancer database curated by the National Cancer Institute 
   and contains molecular data (including genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) 
   of more than 20,000 primary cancer samples from patients and corresponding normal tissue samples 
   of 33 types of cancer. While the extensive scale of TCGA entails its popularity for cancer 
   studies, it can also be difficult to navigate this forest of data.
